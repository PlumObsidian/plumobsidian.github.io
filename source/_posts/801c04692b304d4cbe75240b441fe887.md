## Housing Act 2004 Exceptions

- The Housing Act 2004 primarily applies to residential properties, with exceptions for certain buildings like those occupied by owners or their families, social housing, student halls of residence, and some commercial or institutional properties such as prisons or care homes. The Act also provides exemptions from specific requirements, such as HMO licensing, for buildings that fall under a broader category but are not the intended targets of regulation.

## Properties exempt from certain Housing Act 2004 regulations

- Owner-occupied properties: Properties occupied by an owner, their family, and no more than two tenants or licensees are exempt from certain regulations, such as HMO licensing.
- Social housing: Buildings managed by a local authority, a housing association, or a co-operative society are exempt from some regulations, like mandatory HMO licensing.
- Student accommodations: Halls of residence, or other student accommodations, that are managed by an educational establishment are exempt from HMO licensing.
- Care homes and prisons: Buildings that are regulated under other legislation, such as care homes, boarding schools, or prisons, are exempt from certain HMO regulations.
- Religious communities: Properties occupied by religious communities are exempt from HMO licensing unless they are categorized as a "Section 257 HMO".
